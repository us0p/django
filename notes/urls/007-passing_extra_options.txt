The path() function can take an optional third argument which should be a 
dictionary of extra keyword arguments to pass to the view function.

Example:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("blog/<int:year>/", views.year_archive, {"foo": "bar"}),
]
```

In this example, for a request to /blog/2005/, Django will call 
views.year_archive(request, year=2005, foo='bar').

Note:
    1. It's possible to have conflicts between the captured arguments in the 
       url and in the dictionary. When this happens, the arguments in the 
       dictionary will be used instead of the arguments captured in the URL.
    2. You can also pass extra options to include() and each line in 
       the included URLconf will be passed the extra options.
       This technique is only useful if you’re certain that every view in 
       the included URLconf accepts the extra options you’re passing.

To design URLs for an app, you create a Python module informally called a 
URLconf (urls.py). This module is pure Python code and is a mapping between
URL path expressions to Python functions (your views).
This mapping can be as short or as long as needed. It can reference other 
mappings. And, because itâ€™s pure Python code, it can be constructed 
dynamically.

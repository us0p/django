The following path converters are available by default:

str - Matches any non-empty string, excluding the path separator, '/'. This
      is the default if a converter isnâ€™t included in the expression.
int - Matches zero or any positive integer. Returns an int.
slug - Matches any slug string consisting of ASCII letters or numbers, plus
       the hyphen and underscore characters. For example, 
       building-your-1st-django-site.
uuid - Matches a formatted UUID. To prevent multiple URLs from mapping to 
       the same page, dashes must be included and letters must be 
       lowercase. For example, 075194d3-6885-417e-a8a8-6c931e272f00. 
       Returns a UUID instance.
path - Matches any non-empty string, including the path separator, '/'. 
       This allows you to match against a complete URL path rather than a 
       segment of a URL path as with str.

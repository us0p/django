When Django canâ€™t find a match for the requested URL, or when an exception 
is raised, Django invokes an error-handling view.

The views to use for these cases are specified by four variables. Their 
default values should suffice for most projects, but further customization 
is possible by overriding their default values.

Such values can be set in your root URLconf. Setting these variables in any
other URLconf will have no effect.

Values must be callables, or strings representing the full Python import 
path to the view that should be called to handle the error condition at 
hand.

The variables are:
    handler400 = "<app_name>.<views_module>.<view_name>"
    handler403 = "<app_name>.<views_module>.<view_name>"
    handler404 = "<app_name>.<views_module>.<view_name>"
    handler500 = "<app_name>.<views_module>.<view_name>"

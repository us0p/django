To add static files to your app:
- create a directory static within the app, it's similar to how the
  template directory work.
  e.g.: <app_dir>/static/<app_name>/<static_file_name>

Django’s STATICFILES_FINDERS setting contains a list of finders that know 
how to discover static files from various sources. One of the defaults is 
AppDirectoriesFinder which looks for a “static” subdirectory in each of the
INSTALLED_APPS. The admin site uses the same directory structure for its 
static files.

if you want to add subdirectories for your static files you should add them
insilde static/<app_name>/:
e.g.: .../static/<app_name>/images

The {% static %} template tag is not available for use in static files 
which aren’t generated by Django, like your stylesheet. You should always 
use relative paths to link your static files between each other, because 
then you can change STATIC_URL (used by the static template tag to generate
its URLs) without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as
well.

Dealing with streaming responses
Unlike HttpResponse, StreamingHttpResponse does not have a content 
attribute. As a result, middleware can no longer assume that all responses 
will have a content attribute. If they need access to the content, they 
must test for streaming responses and adjust their behavior accordingly

streaming_content should be assumed to be too large to hold in memory.
Response middleware may wrap it in a new generator, but must not consume 
it.
StreamingHttpResponse allows both synchronous and asynchronous iterators.
The wrapping func tion must match.

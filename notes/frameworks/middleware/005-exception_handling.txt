Exception handling
Django automatically converts exceptions raised by the view or by 
middleware into an appropriate HTTP response with an error status code. 
Certain exceptions are converted to 4xx status codes, while an unknown 
exception is converted to a 500 status code.
This conversion takes place before and after each middleware (you can think
of it as the thin film in between each layer of the onion), so that every 
middleware can always rely on getting some kind of HTTP response back from 
calling its get_response callable

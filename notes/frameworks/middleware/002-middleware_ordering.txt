Some hints about the ordering of various Django middleware classes:

01. SecurityMiddleware
    It should go near the top of the list if you’re going to turn on the 
    SSL redirect as that avoids running through a bunch of other 
    unnecessary middleware.
02. UpdateCacheMiddleware
    Before those that modify the Vary header (SessionMiddleware, 
    GZipMiddleware, LocaleMiddleware).
03. GZipMiddleware
    Before any middleware that may change or use the response body.
    After UpdateCacheMiddleware: Modifies Vary header.
04. SessionMiddleware
    Before any middleware that may raise an exception to trigger an error 
    view (such as PermissionDenied) if you’re using CSRF_USE_SESSIONS.
    After UpdateCacheMiddleware: Modifies Vary header.
05. ConditionalGetMiddleware
    Before any middleware that may change the response (it sets the ETag 
    header).
    After GZipMiddleware so it won’t calculate an ETag header on gzipped 
    contents.
06. LocaleMiddleware
    One of the topmost, after SessionMiddleware (uses session data) and 
    UpdateCacheMiddleware (modifies Vary header).
07. CommonMiddleware
    Before any middleware that may change the response (it sets the 
    Content-Length header). A middleware that appears before 
    CommonMiddleware and changes the response must reset Content-Length.
    Close to the top: it redirects when APPEND_SLASH or PREPEND_WWW are set
    to True.
    After SessionMiddleware if you’re using CSRF_USE_SESSIONS.
08. CsrfViewMiddleware
    Before any view middleware that assumes that CSRF attacks have been 
    dealt with.
    Before RemoteUserMiddleware, or any other authentication middleware 
    that may perform a login, and hence rotate the CSRF token, before 
    calling down the middleware chain.
    After SessionMiddleware if you’re using CSRF_USE_SESSIONS.
09. AuthenticationMiddleware
    After SessionMiddleware: uses session storage.
10. LoginRequiredMiddleware
    After AuthenticationMiddleware: uses user object.
11. MessageMiddleware
    After SessionMiddleware: can use session-based storage.
12. FetchFromCacheMiddleware
    After any middleware that modifies the Vary header: that header is used
    to pick a value for the cache hash-key.
13. FlatpageFallbackMiddleware
    Should be near the bottom as it’s a last-resort type of middleware.
14. RedirectFallbackMiddleware
    Should be near the bottom as it’s a last-resort type of middleware.

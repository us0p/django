Models
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It
contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. 
Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

- Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
- Each attribute of the model represents a database field.

Subclasses of models.Model have a default id column implementation of type
models.BigAutoField.

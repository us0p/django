Query expressions
Describe a value or a computation that can be used as part of an update, 
create, filter, order by, annotation, or aggregate. When an expression 
outputs a boolean value, it may be used directly in filters. Expressions 
can be combined, or in some cases nested, to form more complex 
computations.

Output field
Many of the expressions in this section support an optional 
output_field parameter. If given, Django will load the value into that 
field after retrieving it from the database.
output_field takes a model field instance, like IntegerField() or 
BooleanField(). Usually, the field doesn’t need any arguments, like 
max_length, since field arguments relate to data validation which will not
be performed on the expression’s output value.
output_field is only required when Django is unable to automatically 
determine the result’s field type, such as complex expressions that mix 
field types. For example, adding a DecimalField() and a FloatField() 
requires an output field, like output_field=FloatField().

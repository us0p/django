Aggregate()
An aggregate expression is a special case of a Func() expression that 
informs the query that a GROUP BY clause is required. All of the aggregate
functions, like Sum() and Count(), inherit from Aggregate().

Since Aggregates are expressions and wrap expressions, you can represent 
some complex computations:

from django.db.models import Count
Company.objects.annotate(
    managers_required=(Count("num_employees") / 4) + Count("num_managers")
)

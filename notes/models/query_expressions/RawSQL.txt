RawSQL()

from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL
queryset.annotate(
    val=RawSQL(
	"select col from sometable where othercol = %s",
	(param,)
    )
)

To protect against SQL injection attacks, you must escape any parameters 
that the user can control by using params. params is a required argument to
force you to acknowledge that youâ€™re not interpolating your SQL with 
user-provided data.
You also must not quote placeholders in the SQL string.

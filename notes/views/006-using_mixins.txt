Using Mixins
Mixins are a form of multiple inheritance where behaviors and attributes of
multiple parent classes can be combined.
Mixins are an excellent way of reusing code across multiple classes, but 
they come with some cost. The more your code is scattered among mixins, the
harder it will be to read a child class and know what exactly it is doing, 
and the harder it will be to know which methods from which mixins to 
override if you are subclassing something that has a deep inheritance tree.
Note also that you can only inherit from one generic view - that is, only 
one parent class may inherit from View and the rest (if any) should be 
mixins.

Django provides high-level and low-level ways to help you manage paginated
data.

Under the hood, all methods of pagination use the Paginator class. It does
all the heavy lifting of actually splliting a QuerySet into Page objects.

```python
from django.core.paginator import Paginator

objects = ["john","paul","george","ringo"]
p = Paginator(
	objects, # a list of objects to paginate.
	2        # the number of items on each page.
    )
```

Note that you can give Paginator a list/tuple, a Django QuerySet or any 
other object with a coun() or __len__() method.

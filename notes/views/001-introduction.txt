A view function, or view for short, is a Python function that takes a web 
request and returns a web response. The view itself contains whatever 
arbitrary logic is necessary to return that response. This code can live 
anywhere you want, as long as itâ€™s on your Python path. For the sake of 
putting the code somewhere, the convention is to put views in a file called
views.py, placed in your project or application directory.

Each view function takes an HttpRequest object as its first parameter, 
which is typically named request.
The view returns an HttpResponse object that contains the generated 
response. Each view function is responsible for returning an HttpResponse 
object.

```python
from django.http import HttpRespose

Django provides several decorators that can be applied to views to support 
various HTTP features.

Allowed HTTP methods
A group of decorators that can be used to restrict access to views based on
the request method.
Can be imported from django.views.decorators.http:

- require_http_methods(request_method_list): require that a view only accepts listed methods. Methods should be in uppercase.
- require_GET(): require that view only accepts the GET method.
- require_POST(): require that view only accepts the POST method.

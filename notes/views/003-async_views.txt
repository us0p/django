Async views
As well as being synchronous functions, views can also be asynchronous 
(“async”) functions.
Django will automatically detect these and run them in an async context. 
However, you will need to use an async server based on ASGI to get their 
performance benefits.

Async class-based views
As well as the synchronous method handlers, View subclasses may define 
asynchronous method handlers to leverage asynchronous code using await.
Within a single view-class, all user-defined method handlers must be either
synchronous, using def, or all asynchronous, using async def. An 
ImproperlyConfigured exception will be raised in as_view() if def and async
def declarations are mixed.

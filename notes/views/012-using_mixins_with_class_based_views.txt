Not all mixins can be used together, and not all generic class based views
can be used with all other mixins.

Each of your views should use only mixins or views from one of the groups
of generic class-based views: detail, list, editing and date. For example
it’s fine to combine TemplateView (built in view) with MultipleObjectMixin
(generic list), but you’re likely to have problems combining
SingleObjectMixin (generic detail) with MultipleObjectMixin (generic list).

If you need a class-based view that implement more than one mixin. You
should create different classes for each mixin and groups the expected
behaviour under another class by calling each views .as_view() method.
